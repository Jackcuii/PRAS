Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution's claim that our client’s privacy policy lacks transparency is unfounded. The policy explicitly states that users are required to agree to an applicable Notice *before* using BlackBerry Offerings, and this Notice contains additional information regarding the processing of personal data. This establishes a clear, two-step consent framework where users are first made aware of the general policy and then provided with further details in the applicable Notice.  

The GDPR does not mandate that every granular detail of data processing must be contained in a single document. Rather, it requires transparency and accessibility—both of which are satisfied here. The policy directs users to the Notice, ensuring they have full visibility into how their data is handled before proceeding. This layered approach is both lawful and fair, as it avoids overwhelming users with excessive information upfront while still ensuring informed consent.  

Furthermore, the prosecution’s interpretation would impose an impractical burden on companies to cram all processing details into a single policy, which could undermine clarity rather than enhance it. Our client’s method is compliant, user-friendly, and fully aligned with the GDPR’s principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.  

We urge the court to dismiss these charges.

The policy explicitly states that users are required to agree to an applicable Notice *before* using BlackBerry Offerings, and this Notice contains additional information regarding the processing of personal data.

Prosecutor1: 
**Prosecution's Rebuttal:**  

Your Honor, the defense’s argument hinges on the assumption that redirecting users to an unspecified "applicable Notice" satisfies the GDPR’s transparency requirements. This is misleading. The privacy policy fails to disclose *what* personal data is processed, *for what purposes*, or *how long it is retained*—core elements mandated by Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR. Merely alluding to a separate Notice, without even summarizing its contents or guaranteeing its accessibility, is insufficient.  

The defense claims this "two-step framework" ensures informed consent, yet the policy provides no evidence that the Notice is presented *before* data processing begins, as required. Without concrete examples or proof of this Notice’s contents, the policy remains opaque, leaving users unaware of their rights or risks. The GDPR explicitly requires transparency *at the time of collection*—not deferred to an unspecified document.  

Furthermore, the defense’s assertion that detailing processing activities would "overwhelm users" contradicts the GDPR’s intent. Transparency is not optional for convenience; it is a legal obligation. The policy’s vagueness—failing even to name the types of data processed—renders it inherently unfair and unlawful.  

We stand by our position: this policy violates the principle of transparency, and the company must be held accountable.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s assertion that the privacy policy fails to meet GDPR transparency requirements is a mischaracterization of both the law and the facts. The policy explicitly states that users must agree to an applicable Notice *before* using BlackBerry Offerings, and this Notice contains the specific details of data processing. This structure ensures transparency by providing users with clear, accessible information at the point of consent—precisely when it matters most.  

The GDPR does not prescribe a rigid format for privacy disclosures; it demands meaningful transparency. Our client’s approach—a concise policy supplemented by a detailed Notice—is not only compliant but also aligns with regulatory guidance advocating for layered privacy notices. The prosecution’s narrow interpretation would force companies to overload users with dense, monolithic documents, undermining comprehension and violating the very principle of fairness they claim to uphold.  

Moreover, the prosecution’s "decision" ignores the practical reality of modern data processing, where flexibility in disclosure methods is essential to balance clarity with usability. Our client’s framework ensures users are fully informed without sacrificing accessibility.  

We stand by our position that the policy meets GDPR standards and urge the court to reject the prosecution’s overreach. The charges should be dismissed.

Prosecutor1: 
<Prosecutor>Your Honor, the defense’s reliance on an "applicable Notice" as a cure-all for transparency fails to address the core issue: the privacy policy itself does not fulfill the GDPR’s requirement for upfront clarity. Merely deferring critical details to another document—without even summarizing the nature of processing or providing a direct link to the Notice—creates ambiguity, not transparency. The GDPR’s principle of fairness demands that users understand the *substance* of data processing *before* consent, not just its existence.  

The defense’s claim that layered notices suffice is misleading. The policy does not specify where, when, or how this Notice is presented, leaving users in the dark about whether they will encounter it at all. This is not a "user-friendly" approach—it is a loophole that undermines informed consent. The prosecution’s interpretation does not demand a "monolithic" document; it demands that the policy itself, as the primary point of contact, provide meaningful transparency, which it blatantly fails to do.  

The defense’s argument about "practical reality" is a red herring. Compliance is not optional, and the GDPR explicitly requires that transparency be proactive, not buried in secondary documents. The policy’s vagueness violates the very essence of "lawfulness, fairness, and transparency." The charges stand.</Prosecutor>

Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s repeated insistence on a singular, exhaustive privacy policy misinterprets both the letter and spirit of the GDPR. The regulation explicitly allows for layered privacy notices—a widely accepted practice endorsed by regulators to enhance user understanding. Our client’s policy clearly signposts users to the applicable Notice, which contains the granular details of data processing. This method is not only compliant but *superior* to a monolithic document, as it prevents information fatigue while ensuring transparency at the critical moment of consent.  

The prosecution’s rigid stance contradicts the GDPR’s Recital 58, which encourages “innovative methods” to deliver privacy information. By dismissing this approach, they effectively argue against user-centric design—a position that would set a harmful precedent, forcing companies to prioritize legalistic verbosity over actual user comprehension.  

Furthermore, the prosecution has failed to demonstrate any actual harm or confusion caused by this structure. Absent evidence of real-world detriment, their claim of non-transparency is purely theoretical. The GDPR demands proportionality, and our client’s policy meets that standard.  

We reiterate: the charges are baseless and must be dismissed.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, my client’s privacy policy clearly communicates the purposes for which personal data is processed, and the agreement to the notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings constitutes a valid and transparent mechanism for obtaining consent under the GDPR. The policy does not rely on *implied* consent but rather on the affirmative act of agreeing to the notice or choosing to use the services—an action that demonstrates a clear and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes, as required by **Article 4(11) and Article 7 of the GDPR**.  

Furthermore, the GDPR does not mandate a specific *form* of consent beyond ensuring it is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The European Data Protection Board’s guidelines acknowledge that consent can be obtained through various means, including digital agreements, provided the conditions of transparency and fairness are met. My client’s policy meets these standards by clearly outlining the purposes of processing at the point of consent.  

The prosecution’s argument conflates *implied* consent—which would indeed be insufficient—with *explicit* consent obtained through a deliberate user action. There is no evidence of coercion or lack of transparency in this case. Therefore, the processing of personal data under this policy fully complies with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under **Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR**.  

I urge the court to dismiss the claim that this policy violates GDPR requirements.

Prosecutor1: 
**Prosecution's Rebuttal:**  

Your Honor, the defense’s argument mischaracterizes the nature of consent under the GDPR. The privacy policy in question states that consent is derived merely from the *use of BlackBerry Offerings* or agreement to the notice—a classic example of *implied* consent, not the *explicit* consent required by **Article 4(11) and Article 7**. The GDPR explicitly prohibits bundling consent with general terms of service or conditioning access to services on the acceptance of data processing without a genuine, separate opt-in.  

The defense claims transparency, yet the policy fails to provide a clear, affirmative action—such as an unchecked opt-in box—that would demonstrate unambiguous consent. The European Data Protection Board’s guidelines emphasize that *silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity* cannot constitute valid consent. Here, the policy relies on the mere act of using the service, which falls squarely into the category of insufficient consent mechanisms the GDPR was designed to eliminate.  

Furthermore, the principle of *fairness* under **Article 5(1)(a)** is violated because users are not given a true choice—they must either accept the processing of their data or forego the service entirely. This is not freely given consent, as required by **Recital 42**.  

The defense’s reliance on "deliberate user action" is misleading. Using a service is not equivalent to a deliberate, specific, and informed agreement to data processing. The policy’s language is inherently deceptive, as it suggests consent is automatic rather than explicitly obtained.  

For these reasons, the court must uphold the finding that this policy violates the GDPR’s principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. The defense’s motion to dismiss should be denied.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s assertion that my client’s privacy policy relies on *implied* consent is a mischaracterization of the facts. The policy explicitly states that consent is obtained through the user’s agreement to the notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings—an active and deliberate action that satisfies the GDPR’s standard for explicit consent under **Article 4(11)**. The GDPR does not prescribe a rigid format for consent; it merely requires that consent be *unambiguous* and *demonstrated by a clear affirmative action*. My client’s mechanism meets this threshold.  

Moreover, the prosecution overlooks the principle of **contextual transparency** upheld by the GDPR. The policy clearly discloses the purposes of processing at the point of consent, ensuring users are fully informed—a requirement under **Article 5(1)(a)**. The European Data Protection Board’s *Guidelines on Consent* (WP259) explicitly state that consent can be obtained through digital interactions, provided the user’s intent is clear. Here, the act of using the services after reviewing the notice constitutes such intent.  

The prosecution’s narrow interpretation of "explicit consent" conflates it with formalistic requirements, which the GDPR deliberately avoids. My client’s approach aligns with the regulation’s emphasis on *substance over form*. There is no evidence of unfairness or opacity in this process.  

I urge the court to reject the prosecution’s flawed reasoning and affirm that my client’s policy complies with the GDPR in both letter and spirit.

Prosecutor1: 
**Prosecutor's Rebuttal:**  

Your Honor, the defense continues to misrepresent the nature of consent under the GDPR. The privacy policy in question conflates the mere *use of services* with explicit consent, which is a direct violation of **Article 4(11) and Article 7**. The GDPR mandates that consent must be a *freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication* of the data subject’s wishes—not a blanket agreement inferred from passive actions like continuing to use a service.  

The defense’s reliance on "contextual transparency" is misleading. While the policy may disclose purposes, it fails to ensure that consent is *separately and affirmatively obtained* as required by **Recital 32 of the GDPR**, which explicitly rejects pre-ticked boxes or inactivity as valid consent. Here, the policy’s wording—"your agreement to the Notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings"—effectively treats continued use as consent, which the Court of Justice of the EU has repeatedly condemned (e.g., *Planet49*, C-673/17).  

Furthermore, the defense’s reference to "substance over form" ignores the GDPR’s clear intent to *prevent* exactly this type of bundled consent. The European Data Protection Board’s guidelines emphasize that consent must be *granular and distinguishable* from other terms—a standard this policy blatantly violates.  

The prosecution stands by its original position: this policy unlawfully substitutes implied consent for explicit consent, undermining the GDPR’s core principles of fairness and transparency. The court must hold the defendant accountable.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s repeated insistence on labeling my client’s consent mechanism as "implied" ignores the unambiguous language of the policy and the GDPR’s flexibility in obtaining valid consent. The policy explicitly ties consent to the user’s *agreement to the notice* or *use of services*—both of which are affirmative actions that satisfy **Article 7(1)**’s requirement for a "clear affirmative act." The GDPR’s *Recital 32* explicitly states that consent can be given "by a written or oral statement, including by electronic means," which encompasses my client’s approach.  

The prosecution’s rigid interpretation contradicts the *CJEU’s ruling in Planet49 (C-673/17)*, which emphasized that consent must be *active* but did not prescribe a specific method. Here, users are presented with a notice and must take a deliberate step to proceed—far from passive "implied" consent. The policy’s transparency is further evidenced by its clear articulation of processing purposes, fulfilling **Article 13**’s disclosure obligations.  

The prosecution’s argument also disregards the *practical reality of digital services*, where consent is often operationalized through use. The GDPR’s principles are not violated simply because consent is integrated into service access, provided the user’s autonomy and awareness are preserved—as they are here.  

I urge the court to recognize that my client’s policy adheres to the GDPR’s substantive requirements and reject the prosecution’s conflation of *integration* with *implication*. There is no violation of lawfulness, fairness, or transparency.

The policy explicitly ties consent to the user’s *agreement to the notice* or *use of services*—both of which are affirmative actions that satisfy **Article 7(1)**’s requirement for a "clear affirmative act." The GDPR’s *Recital 32* explicitly states that consent can be given "by a written or oral statement, including by electronic means," which encompasses my client’s approach.  

The prosecution’s rigid interpretation contradicts the *CJEU’s ruling in Planet49 (C-673/17)*, which emphasized that consent must be *active* but did not prescribe a specific method. Here, users are presented with a notice and must take a deliberate step to proceed—far from passive "implied" consent. The policy’s transparency is further evidenced by its clear articulation of processing purposes, fulfilling **Article 13**’s disclosure obligations.  

The prosecution’s argument also disregards the *practical reality of digital services*, where consent is often operationalized through use. The GDPR’s principles are not violated simply because consent is integrated into service access, provided the user’s autonomy and awareness are preserved—as they are here.  

I urge the court to recognize that my client’s policy adheres to the GDPR’s substantive requirements and reject the prosecution’s conflation of *integration* with *implication*. There is no violation of lawfulness, fairness, or transparency.</Lawyer>

God to J: 
You are a Judge in the court who is going to decide whether to sentence a company by violating GDPR. You should comprehend the debate between the prosecutor and the lawyer and find out who is right. Then you should decide whether to sentence the company or not. You should answer me with \{ "decision" : "guilty"/"innocent" , "explanation": "..." \} Do not includes any other words or markdown format.Here are the records of the court. <suspected Privacy Policy> <privacy policy>Your agreement to the Notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings indicates your consent for BlackBerry to process your personal information for BlackBerry's identified purposes.</privacy policy> </suspected Privacy Policy> <violated GDPR item> <GDPR item>Personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’).</GDPR item> </violated GDPR item>  <Sentence Reason> The privacy policy implies consent through the use of services, which does not align with the GDPR requirement for lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data. GDPR requires explicit consent, not implied through service use. </Sentence Reason>

 Debate: 

<Lawyer>**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, my client’s privacy policy clearly communicates the purposes for which personal data is processed, and the agreement to the notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings constitutes a valid and transparent mechanism for obtaining consent under the GDPR. The policy does not rely on *implied* consent but rather on the affirmative act of agreeing to the notice or choosing to use the services—an action that demonstrates a clear and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes, as required by **Article 4(11) and Article 7 of the GDPR**.  

Furthermore, the GDPR does not mandate a specific *form* of consent beyond ensuring it is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. The European Data Protection Board’s guidelines acknowledge that consent can be obtained through various means, including digital agreements, provided the conditions of transparency and fairness are met. My client’s policy meets these standards by clearly outlining the purposes of processing at the point of consent.  

The prosecution’s argument conflates *implied* consent—which would indeed be insufficient—with *explicit* consent obtained through a deliberate user action. There is no evidence of coercion or lack of transparency in this case. Therefore, the processing of personal data under this policy fully complies with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency under **Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR**.  

I urge the court to dismiss the claim that this policy violates GDPR requirements.</Lawyer>

<Prosecutor>{"decision": "yes", "explanation": "The privacy policy implies consent through the use of services, which does not align with the GDPR requirement for lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data. GDPR requires explicit consent, not implied through service use."}</Prosecutor>

<Lawyer>**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s assertion that my client’s privacy policy relies on *implied* consent is a mischaracterization of the facts. The policy explicitly states that consent is obtained through the user’s agreement to the notice or use of BlackBerry Offerings—an active and deliberate action that satisfies the GDPR’s standard for explicit consent under **Article 4(11)**. The GDPR does not prescribe a rigid format for consent; it merely requires that consent be *unambiguous* and *demonstrated by a clear affirmative action*. My client’s mechanism meets this threshold.  

Moreover, the prosecution overlooks the principle of **contextual transparency** upheld by the GDPR. The policy clearly discloses the purposes of processing at the point of consent, ensuring users are fully informed—a requirement under **Article 5(1)(a)**. The European Data Protection Board’s *Guidelines on Consent* (WP259) explicitly state that consent can be obtained through digital interactions, provided the user’s intent is clear. Here, the act of using the services after reviewing the notice constitutes such intent.  

The prosecution’s narrow interpretation of "explicit consent" conflates it with formalistic requirements, which the GDPR deliberately avoids. My client’s approach aligns with the regulation’s emphasis on *substance over form*. There is no evidence of unfairness or opacity in this process.  

I urge the court to reject the prosecution’s flawed reasoning and affirm that my client’s policy complies with the GDPR in both letter and spirit.</Lawyer>

**Defense Lawyer's Statement:**  

"Your Honor, the prosecution’s argument mischaracterizes the clarity and compliance of BlackBerry’s privacy policy. The phrase 'BlackBerry’s identified purposes' is not inherently vague—it is a reference to the clearly articulated purposes detailed elsewhere in our comprehensive documentation, including our full Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, which users are directed to review. The GDPR does not require every conceivable purpose to be listed in a single sentence; it permits contextual clarity across linked documents.  

Moreover, the prosecution ignores the principle of *informed consent* under GDPR. By agreeing to the Notice, users affirm their understanding that BlackBerry processes data for purposes explicitly tied to the functionality and improvement of its offerings—purposes that are both legitimate and predictable for a technology provider. The policy’s language aligns with Recital 32 of the GDPR, which acknowledges consent can be obtained through unambiguous indications, including conduct.  

We also dispute the claim of incompatibility. BlackBerry’s processing adheres to the principle of purpose limitation because all uses of data are circumscribed by the reasonable expectations of users engaging with a business-oriented platform. There is no evidence of ‘further processing’ for unrelated or undisclosed aims.  

The prosecution’s rigid interpretation would reduce privacy policies to impractical lengths, undermining usability without enhancing transparency. BlackBerry’s policy meets the GDPR’s standards, and we urge the court to reject this overreach."

Prosecutor1: 
**Prosecutor's Rebuttal:**  

"Your Honor, the defense’s argument is a deliberate obfuscation of the GDPR’s clear requirements. The phrase 'BlackBerry’s identified purposes' is not merely a reference to other documents—it is an impermissibly vague catch-all that fails to specify *what those purposes are* at the point of consent, violating Article 5(1)(b)’s mandate for *explicit* and *specified* purposes. The GDPR does not permit companies to bury critical processing intentions in scattered documentation and call that compliance. Consent must be informed *at the time of collection*, not contingent on users hunting through appendices.  

The defense’s appeal to 'reasonable expectations' is equally flawed. GDPR Article 4(11) requires consent to be *unambiguous* and *specific*—not inferred from a user’s presumed familiarity with industry norms. A 'business-oriented platform' is not a legal justification for omitting concrete purposes.  

Furthermore, the defense misrepresents Recital 32. Conduct can indicate consent *only* when coupled with clear, upfront disclosure—not when masked by undefined terms like 'identified purposes.' The prosecution’s interpretation is not 'rigid'; it is the law. BlackBerry’s policy fails the most basic test: it does not tell users *what they are agreeing to*. The court must uphold the principle of purpose limitation and hold BlackBerry accountable for this violation."
