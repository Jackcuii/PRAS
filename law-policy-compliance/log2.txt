Lawyer: 
**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, while the prosecution argues that my client’s privacy policy lacks transparency by deferring to additional notices, I must respectfully disagree. The policy explicitly states that users *may* be required to agree to an applicable Notice *before* using BlackBerry’s services. This demonstrates proactive intent to inform users of further processing details at the appropriate time—*prior* to engagement.  

The GDPR principle of transparency does not demand every granular detail in the initial policy but requires that users be informed in a clear and accessible manner. Here, the policy sets a clear expectation: additional notices will be presented *before* processing begins, ensuring users are fully aware and can consent meaningfully. This aligns with GDPR’s emphasis on *prior* information (Articles 12–14).  

Moreover, the prosecution’s interpretation would render layered privacy notices—a common and GDPR-compliant practice—unlawful. The European Data Protection Board itself acknowledges that supplementary notices are permissible if the initial policy signposts their existence, as my client’s does.  

We contend that the policy is lawful, fair, and transparent, as it ensures users are informed *before* their data is processed—not after. Thank you.

<Lawyer>**Defense Statement:**  

Your Honor, while the prosecution argues that my client’s privacy policy lacks transparency by deferring to additional notices, I must respectfully disagree. The policy explicitly states that users *may* be required to agree to an applicable Notice *before* using BlackBerry’s services. This demonstrates proactive intent to inform users of further processing details at the appropriate time—*prior* to engagement.

Prosecutor1: 
Your Honor, the defense’s argument hinges on the claim that deferring transparency to later notices is compliant, but this is a misreading of GDPR’s core principles. The policy’s language—“*may* be required to agree to an applicable Notice”—creates ambiguity, not clarity. GDPR mandates that data subjects be informed *upfront* of the *essential* processing details, not left to discover them piecemeal through conditional notices.  

The defense cites “layered notices” as justification, but this practice presupposes that the *initial* layer is sufficiently transparent about the *scope and purpose* of processing. Here, the policy fails even to specify what categories of data or purposes might be covered by these nebulous “additional notices.” This is not layering—it is obfuscation.  

Furthermore, the defense’s reliance on Articles 12–14 undermines their case. These articles require information to be provided *at the time of data collection*, not at some indeterminate future point contingent on user action. By admitting that notices are only presented *if* users proceed, the policy violates the GDPR’s requirement for *prior* transparency—not as an afterthought.  

The prosecution stands by its position: this policy unlawfully shifts the burden of discovery onto users, breaching the principle of fairness and transparency. The defense’s interpretation would greenlight policies that hide critical details behind procedural hurdles, a practice the GDPR expressly forbids.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Rebuttal:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s assertion that the privacy policy fails to provide "clear and transparent information upfront" misinterprets both the GDPR’s requirements and the practical realities of data processing. The GDPR does not mandate that *every* detail of processing must be crammed into a single document at the outset. Rather, it emphasizes *meaningful* transparency—ensuring users are informed *before* their data is processed, which is precisely what my client’s policy achieves.  

The phrase "you *may* be required to agree to an applicable Notice" is not evasion; it is a reasonable acknowledgment that different services or jurisdictions may necessitate tailored disclosures. This is a standard and compliant approach, as confirmed by regulatory guidance (e.g., the EDPB’s endorsement of layered notices). Crucially, the policy guarantees that any additional Notice will be presented *before* use of the service, ensuring no processing occurs without prior user awareness.  

To penalize this approach would undermine the flexibility the GDPR intentionally affords controllers to provide information in stages—so long as it is timely and unambiguous. My client’s policy meets this bar. The prosecution’s rigid interpretation would stifle practical compliance and ignore the policy’s explicit commitment to prior disclosure. We urge the court to reject this overreach. Thank you.

Prosecutor1: 
Your Honor, the defense’s repeated reliance on the notion of "prior disclosure" is a red herring. The GDPR’s principle of transparency is not satisfied by vague, conditional statements that shunt critical information to unspecified future notices. The policy states users *may* be required to agree to additional notices—not *will*—creating uncertainty about whether, when, or how such disclosures will occur. This is the antithesis of "clear and transparent" information under Article 5(1)(a).  

The defense cites layered notices as a compliant practice, but the EDPB’s guidance explicitly requires the *initial* layer to provide "essential information" upfront—not merely a placeholder for it. Here, the policy fails to even identify the *categories* of data processed or the purposes, instead offloading all material details to hypothetical future notices. This is not flexibility; it is opacity masquerading as compliance.  

Moreover, the defense’s claim that users are informed "before processing begins" is speculative. The policy’s wording allows for scenarios where users encounter these notices *after* initiating use—a direct violation of GDPR’s requirement for prior, unambiguous consent. The prosecution’s interpretation is not rigid; it is foundational. Without clear upfront disclosure, users cannot make informed choices, rendering any subsequent "layers" meaningless. The court must uphold the GDPR’s standard: transparency cannot be deferred.

Lawyer: 
**Defense Closing Argument:**  

Your Honor, the prosecution’s repeated insistence on a rigid, one-size-fits-all interpretation of transparency under GDPR is not only impractical but legally unsupported. The GDPR’s principle of transparency (Article 5(1)(a)) is satisfied when data subjects are provided with clear, accessible, and *timely* information—not necessarily *all* information in a single document at first glance. My client’s privacy policy explicitly signals that further details will be provided *before* any processing occurs, ensuring users are fully informed at the critical moment of consent or engagement.  

The European Data Protection Board’s guidelines explicitly permit layered privacy notices, recognizing that complex services often require contextual disclosures. By stating upfront that additional Notices *may* apply—and ensuring they are presented *prior* to service use—my client goes beyond mere compliance; it embraces best practices for user-centric transparency.  

The prosecution’s stance would effectively outlaw the very flexibility the GDPR envisions for tailored, context-aware disclosures. This cannot be the law’s intent. We urge the court to affirm that transparency is achieved through clarity of process, not volume of text, and to dismiss this charge. Thank you.

Prosecutor1: 
**Prosecution's Final Argument:**  

Your Honor, the defense's reliance on the notion of "layered notices" is a red herring. The GDPR's principle of transparency requires that data subjects be informed *at the outset* in a clear and unambiguous manner—not through vague, conditional statements that defer critical details to unspecified future notices. The phrase "you *may* be required to agree to an applicable Notice" is inherently opaque. It fails to disclose *what* personal data will be processed, *for what purposes*, or *under what legal basis*—core requirements under Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR.  

The defense claims this approach is "timely," but "timely" under GDPR means *before data collection begins*, not buried in subsequent documents users might only encounter after initial engagement. The policy’s wording creates uncertainty, leaving users unaware of their rights or the scope of processing until after they’ve already invested time or effort into the service. This is the antithesis of fairness and transparency.  

The EDPB’s guidance on layered notices does not absolve controllers of their obligation to provide *essential* information upfront. Here, the policy provides *nothing* substantive—only a placeholder for future disclosures. That is not compliance; it is evasion. The court must uphold the GDPR’s standards by holding the defendant accountable for this failure. The violation is clear, and the sentence stands. Thank you.

Lawyer: 
Your Honor, my client’s privacy policy is fully compliant with the GDPR principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. The statement in question clearly communicates to users that their agreement to the notice or use of BlackBerry’s services constitutes consent for the processing of their personal information for specified purposes. This is not an implied or inferred consent—it is an explicit acknowledgment presented to users at the point of engagement.  

Furthermore, the GDPR does not prescribe a singular method for obtaining consent, provided it is unambiguous and affirmative. The policy in question meets this standard by requiring users to actively agree to the terms or use the services, thereby demonstrating a deliberate and informed choice. The transparency of the policy ensures users are fully aware of how their data will be processed, aligning perfectly with the GDPR’s emphasis on clarity and fairness.  

The prosecution’s interpretation overlooks the fact that consent can be obtained through various means, as long as it meets the GDPR’s criteria. My client’s approach is both lawful and transparent, and we respectfully submit that no violation has occurred.

Prosecutor1: 
Your Honor, the defense’s argument mischaracterizes the nature of consent under the GDPR. The privacy policy in question fails to meet the standard of *explicit* consent, as required by Article 4(11) and Article 7 of the GDPR. Merely stating that use of services constitutes consent is not equivalent to obtaining a clear, affirmative action from the user—such as a checkbox or unambiguous opt-in—that demonstrates a freely given, specific, and informed agreement.  

The policy’s language conflates mere use of services with consent, which is precisely the kind of *implied* consent the GDPR prohibits. The regulation explicitly rejects pre-ticked boxes or passive acceptance, and this policy functionally operates on the same principle: users are deemed to consent simply by using the service, without a deliberate, granular action. This undermines both fairness and transparency, as users may not realize their data is being processed under this broad, non-specific "agreement."  

Moreover, the defense’s claim of transparency is misleading. Transparency requires more than just disclosing processing purposes—it requires ensuring users understand *how* to consent and that their consent is *voluntary*. Bundling consent into general terms of use violates this principle, as it does not allow users to genuinely exercise control over their data.  

The prosecution maintains that this policy violates the GDPR’s core tenets of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and the defense’s attempt to reframe passive acceptance as "explicit" consent is legally untenable.
